# Loan-Default-Prediction-System

Today many banks/financial companies approve loans after a regressive process of verification and validation but still there is no guarantee whether the chosen applicant is the deserving right applicant out of all the applicants.
Through this system we can predict whether that particular applicant is safe or not and the whole process of validation of features is automated by machine learning technique.
The dataset used here is Bank Loan Status Dataset from Kaggle ancontains 100514 entries with 19 columns.
The system is based on supervised learning. Decision Tree tool has been used for classification and prediction.
The system will predict whether a loan should be sanctioned to a customer based on the customerâ€™s previous loan payment history.


Conclusion of Analysis:
It can be concluded that the number of customers having Annual Income more than Rs.308587 (mean) and paying off the loan constitutes to more than 99% of the customers who paid off the loan. Thus, the bank can provide loans to customers having Annual Income of more than Rs308587 (mean). 
The analysis shows that the probability of short term loans being fully paid is almost double the probability of long term loans being fully paid. 
It can also be observed that Debt Consolidation is the most popular reason behind taking a loan. Almost 79% of the loans taken for Debt Consolidation are paid off.  Debt consolidation is a form of debt refinancing that entails taking out one loan to pay off many others. 
The relationship between Monthly Debt and Loan Status was also analysed. More than 41% of the customers who had Monthly Debt of more than Rs. 18472.41 could not pay the loan and were charged off by the bank.
It can be concluded that on the basis of feature selection and importance, the most important features for bank loan default prediction are - Credit Score, Current Loan Amount, Monthly Debt and Years of Credit History. Hence, the above inferences were drawn by the analysis of the bank loan dataset.
